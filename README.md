This project involved the design and implementation of an IoT-based attendance system using RFID badges for automatic user registration. All data are end-to-end encrypted and immutably stored on a private Ethereum blockchain via Solidity smart contracts (Ganache), with real-time synchronization to Google Sheets. A Flask-based web interface was developed to guarantee security, data integrity and full traceability through JWT authentication and CSRF protection.
